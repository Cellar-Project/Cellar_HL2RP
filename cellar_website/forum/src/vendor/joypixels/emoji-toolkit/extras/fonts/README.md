## JoyPixels Fonts

There's no better way to port our emoji into your device than through a native font.  We don't have the resources ourselves to construct fonts, so we'll depend on helpful contributions from the open source community.

> Note: Due to their size, the font files have been removed from this repo and instead will be available for download via the JoyPixels.com [download page](https://joypixels.com/download).

### Google Font

  * Update fontconfig cache with `$ fc-cache -f; sudo fc-cache -f`

### JoyPixels SVG-based Color Fonts
Through a cooperative effort with Adobe Systems, JoyPixels created black and white versions of the emoji set which were used, in part, to generate this font. Using these fonts with Firefox or Microsoft Edge, you can enjoy full-color JoyPixels emoji. Black and white images will show as the fall back for systems that are not able to render color SVG fonts. The font is available in the following formats:

  * Open Type Font: [emojione-svg.otf](https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-assets/releases/download/3.1.2/emojione-svg.otf)
  * Web Open Font Format: [emojione-svg.woff](https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-assets/releases/download/3.1.2/emojione-svg.woff)
  * Web Open Font Format 2.0: [emojione-svg.woff2](https://github.com/joypixels/emoji-assets/releases/download/3.1.2/emojione-svg.woff2)
